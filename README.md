# Zorg-s-Store

Welcome to Zorg Store - an online retail book store committed to 
bringing you the best deals on out-of-this-galaxy book titles!

Zorg Store is a web-based project developed under a 
team of five students during their time in 
Software Engineering II Spring 2018.

Zorg Store is hosted via localhost, and so to 
run the project, you will need to have a 
web development stack such as WAMP installed on your computer. 

1. Create a local repo of this project in 
    the WAMP folder, 'www'.

2. Turn on WAMP if it's not already on.

3. Import the store's database into phpMyAdmin. 

        In your web browser, 
        type localhost/phpmyadmin. 
              
              Username: root
              Password: <none>
              Server Choice: MySQL

        Create a new database with 
        the name 'zorgdb'.

        From the tabs located near 
        the top, select 'Import'.

        Click 'Browse' and select 
        'zorgdb.sql' which is located in 
        the Zorg Store folder you've downloaded.

        Click 'Go'. It'll take a few 
        moments while the data is being imported.

        You now have the database and are 
        ready to view and/or modify the website.

4. In your web browser, type 'localhost' in the address 
    bar. This will take you to your localhost directory.

5. Click on the Zorg Store folder.

6. Click on the html folder.

The website should be displaying on your browser.

If not, whoopsies.
