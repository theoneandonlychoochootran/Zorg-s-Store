# Zorg-s-Store

Welcome to Zorg Store - an online retail book store committed to bringing you the best deals on out-of-this-galaxy book titles!

Zorg Store is a web-based project developed under a team of five students during their time in Software Engineering II Spring 2018.

Zorg Store is hosted via localhost, and so to run the project, you will need to have a web development stack such as WAMP installed on your computer. 

Then, create a local repo of this project in the WAMP folder, 'www'.

Turn on WAMP if it's not already on.

Before you can view the website on your browser, you will need to import the store's database into phpMyAdmin. 

In your web browser, type localhost/phpmyadmin. Username: root
Password: <none>
Server Choice: MySQL

Create a new database with the name 'zorgdb'.

From the tabs located near the top, select 'Import'.

Click 'Browse' and select 'zorgdb.sql' located in the Zorg Store folder you've downloaded.

Click 'Go'. It'll take a few moments while the data is being imported.

You now have the database and are equipped to view and/or modify the website.

In your web browser, type 'localhost' in the address bar. This will take you to your localhost directory.

Next, locate and click on the Zorg Store folder. Then  click on the html folder.

The website should display on your browser.

If not, whoopsies.
